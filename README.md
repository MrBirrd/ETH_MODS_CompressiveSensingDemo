# Mathematics of Data Science

## About
This repository contains a small demo of a chosen subject of the course Mathematics of Data Science at ETHZ, given by Prof. Dr. Afonso Bandeira in the fall semester 2021.

You need ``Juypter`` and the packages ``scipy``, ``matplotlib`` and ``numpy`` to run it.

The theory behind it can be found on the [Website](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/teaching.html) of Prof. Bandeira.
